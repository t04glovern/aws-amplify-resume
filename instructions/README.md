- "amplify status" will show you what you've added already and if it's locally configured or deployed
- "amplify \<category\> add" will allow you to add features like user login or a backend API
- "amplify push" will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
- "amplify publish" will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud

## Add GraphQL endpoint

```bash
amplify add api
```

Created a basic structure for the resume career section

```graphql
type Job @model {
  id: ID!
  position: String!
  company: String!
  location: String!
  dates: String!
  summary: String!
  accomplishments: [String]
  competencies: [String]
}

type Detail @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  profession: String!
  location: String
  certified: Boolean!
  citizenship: String
  birthday: String
  email: String
  site: String
  phone: String
  github: String
  stackoverflow: String
}
```

Push the project to create the DB

```bash
amplify push

## If you update the schema
amplify api gql-compile
amplify push
```

![Setup 05](img/setup-05.png)

Under src/aws-exports.js you'll find your endpoint and API key already added for you

```json
const awsmobile = {
    "aws_project_region": "us-east-1",
    "aws_appsync_graphqlEndpoint": "https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/graphql",
    "aws_appsync_region": "us-east-1",
    "aws_appsync_authenticationType": "API_KEY",
    "aws_appsync_apiKey": "da2-6rkv7tfouxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
};
```

## Project Configuration

Add the Amplify dependencies to your project

```bash
npm install aws-amplify aws-amplify-react
```

Then under index.js import the dependencies at the top of the file

```javascript
// Import the Amplify Libraries and config
import Amplify from '@aws-amplify/core'
import config from './aws-exports'
Amplify.configure(config)
```
